# hep-tools

Common tools used in high-energy physics.

At least these at the tools that I commonly use.

Most tools will include an installation script and an example usage code.

It is intented to give newcommers a quick hands-on experience.

## WSL

In HEP, it is better to work in a Unix-like operating system.
However, since I can't afford a Mac, I will have to run Linux inside Windows OS.
This is where Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) comes to the rescue.
The advantage of WSL is, it is fully integrated into Windows, a virtual machine (VM) is not necessary.
The resource kernel is also integrated, you can see your running process from task manager.
I've included a script in *powershell* to install WSL.
