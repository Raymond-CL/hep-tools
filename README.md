# hep-tools

A collection of commonly used tools in high-energy physics (HEP).

This repository is intended to give newcomers a quick, hands-on introduction to a variety of HEP software packages and utilities.  
For each tool, you will typically find:

- An **installation script** to set up the software.
- An **example usage program** to verify the installation and demonstrate basic functionality.

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository is still under construction.  
> Only tools with hyperlinks are currently available.
